        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like listening to music because it keeps me calm It makes me happy.it gives emotions.it changes my mood. <br>My favourite kind of musick-pop, pop, hip hop, rhythm & blues, EDM and also I like a little bit jazz, folk,<br>classical and country. Music can also express your<br> emotions without having you show them the way to do <br>it. Music is powerful in many other ways that could<br> take your feelings away. The important thing that the<br> music takes your feelings when you are sad, nervous,<br> or when tour happy also the music makes you happier.

        <p>My favorite band is BTS or Bangtan Boys is a South Korean boy band made up of seven members. They were created by Big Hit Entertainment in 2013. The members include RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. The group debuted on June 13, 2013 with their EP 2 Cool 4 Skool. They have since released 5 Korean studio albums: Dark & Wild (2014); Wings (2016); Love Yourself: Tear (2018); Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) and BE (2020)<br>In 2015, they found success in the American charts with their fourth extended play (EP), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 entering the U.S Billboard 200. The group is recognized as those who led the Korean Wave into the United States and have broken several sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive an award by the Recording Industry Association of America for their single "Mic Drop".
